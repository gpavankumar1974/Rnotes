Would like some statistical analysis done with the data on the gSheet below 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PE-oJcF7Z-lDijq7ES0cFUTw-_rJUyNh6ixmWeWDp00/edit?usp=sharing

I’m not a statistics expert, so I’m not sure if it’s possible to do a continuous probability with conditions (Ratings, Token Circulation, Funding, Social following)  Curious to see in general what trends  / probabilities there are, and the below


Ratings (column S) and Returns (Column V)
Given a specific rating, what’s the probability that the return (column W) was positive, or negative? Other example What’s the probability that I had a return from 0 - 100%?

In the Tab “ICO Bench Rating” I have continuous distribution given a particular rating. Eg, if a set of returns had a rating of 3, then I plotted out the Pr distribution .. I dont know if that’s a correct method or not. 

2. Token circulation (column R) and Returns (Column V)
Given a range of % in circulation, what is the probability the return (column W) was positive

3. Funding (column N)  and Returns (column v)
How does the amount funded impact the probability of postive returns 

What is the relationship between social media followings (column Z, AA, AB) have on Returns (column V)


Then end goal is the give a final probability based on all these other conditional probabilities. 

I would like to have the raw data you used for the calculations as well, preferable in the Excel sheet.
